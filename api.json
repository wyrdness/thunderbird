      "summary": "An enormous bird creature with reported wingspans of 15-20+ feet, dark plumage, and thunderous wing sounds. Sacred to many Native American nations and reported in modern cryptozoological sightings across North America.",
      "full": "The Thunderbird is one of the most widespread and culturally significant phenomena in Native American traditions, described as a massive bird capable of creating thunder with its wings and lightning from its eyes. In modern cryptozoology, Thunderbird refers to reports of giant birds far exceeding the size of any known species, with wingspans estimated at 15-20 feet or more. These creatures are described with dark plumage, massive bodies, and powerful flight. Modern sightings include the famous 1977 Lawndale, Illinois incident where a giant bird allegedly attempted to carry off a child. The phenomenon bridges ancient spiritual traditions with contemporary cryptozoological investigation, raising questions about surviving prehistoric avians, misidentified known species, or the intersection of folklore and reality."
