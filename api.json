      "full": "The Thunderbird represents one of the most culturally significant and widespread phenomena in North American Indigenous traditions—a massive, powerful bird associated with thunder, lightning, and spiritual power. In modern cryptozoology, \\\"Thunderbird\\\" refers to reports of giant birds with wingspans of 15-20+ feet, far exceeding any known living species. These enormous birds are described with dark plumage, massive bodies, powerful talons, and thunderous wing beats. Modern sightings bridge ancient spiritual traditions with contemporary cryptozoological investigation, raising questions about surviving prehistoric birds, misidentified known species, or the complex relationship between folklore and physical reality. Notable modern incidents include the 1977 Lawndale, Illinois case where a giant bird allegedly attempted to carry off a 10-year-old boy, and the 2001-2002 Pennsylvania \\\"big bird\\\" wave with dozens of witnesses reporting enormous dark birds across the state."
